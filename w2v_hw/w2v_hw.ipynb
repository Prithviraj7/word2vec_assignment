    "# 1. CBOW\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first task is to build our very own CBOW. In this section, you will **NOT** be required to write code for the network. Instead, you will be exploring the model by forming hypothesis and testing them through different parameter settings. Although you don't need to write code, you are encouraged to explore the model by writing code to test things out.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's remind ourselves of the famous quote:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957:11)\n",
    "\n",
    "What this implies is that it is possible to define a word, or *meaning* of a word in a way that describes a prediction task: **the task of predicting the word given the context**. However, one problem still remains: how to represent the meaning of a word? Luckily, there has already been a line of works that suggest a solution: representing the meaning of a word by a vector -- the vector space model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine that we are given a near-perfect vector space model that maps meaning of a word to vector. One of the easiest ways to solve the task then, is that we can literally just use the sum of the context vectors as the inputs, the target word vector as the output, and fit it through a linear model!\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is exactly what CBOW is doing: <img src=\"figures/cbow.png\" alt=\"cobw\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights between the input and hidden layer are the vector space model mapping, and the weights between the hidden and output layer are the linear prediction model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch is that we don't have that near-perfect vector space model given to us! Thus, our goal is to jointly learn (1) a representation of the word, and (2) a prediction model. In the following sections, we will explore how to do that through PyTorch.\n",

The idea of a sanity check is to check for a property that a good model should certainly hold. In our case, since we are training on a movie review dataset, we can safely assume that *'movie'* and *'film'* should have similar representation in a reasonably well-trained model, as they should appear in similar context."

    "Now that you have learned how to evaluate a vector space model, let's explore the model by changing the parameters!\n",

    "For purposes of this question, \"changing the parameters\" can be interpreted broadly: it can include numeric parameters of the model (e.g. the number of dimensions in your embedding), parameters related to the training (e.g. batch size, number of training epochs), and even choices about preprocessing (e.g. decisions that were made about normalization, filtering out of vocabulary, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Form **two hypotheses** about parameter choices and how they are affecting the modeling. For each hypothesis, do some experimentations to explore whether your hypothesis is true or not. In your writeup, for each one explain the hypothesis (and its rationale or the intuitions behind it), your experiments, and any results you obtained. There is no need to include code in your writeup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may not be able to successfully test a hypothesis, either due to long training time or lack of training data. If that happens, instead of experiments and results, talk about what you tried, give an explanation of why it didn't work, and describe what you would have expected to see if the experiment had run successfully.  What's important is showing that you've grounded your answer to this question in a clear understanding of the material; for example, there should be a clear logic to why an experiment you propose would support or refute your hypothesis, even if you don't get to run the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that we are not looking for state of the art performance, in terms of the quality of embeddings (you don't even have to beat the current performance, which is a very low bar). The central goal is for you get hands on and get a feel for how this model behaves using some real data.\n",
    "That said, you are welcome to go beyond what we've provided here, e.g. you could get a model working on a small dataset, and then run it on some larger dataset that is of interest to you. \n",
